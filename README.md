WORK IN PROGRESS

Smokers who want to quit have the nicotine patch. Some people can quit cold 
turkey, others need to step down gradually.

What about gambling addicts? I imagine some of them can quit cold turkey, just 
as some smokers can quit cold turkey. But what about the others, who might need 
some way to step down gradually?

My idea here is that players are given P$1,000 (play money) a day, and the 
balance from previous days carries over. The first day they can play as many 
hands as they like, wagering at least P$10 on each hand. If the money runs out, 
that's it, no more wagering.

Then the second day, a new limit kicks in: the player's balance can't go to 
negative, but neither can it increase by more than 100%. Then on the third day, 
the balance can neither increase nor decrease by more than 100%. And on the 
fourth day, it may neither increase nor decrease by 95%. Or something like that.

Eventually, it would get to the point that the balance can neither increase nor 
decrease by 5%. But hopefully by then the player will have overcome his 
addiction and deleted the app.
